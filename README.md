# ARCH FAST CONFIG

This repository was made to have a quick and customizable installation of hyprland for Arch.

# Installation

First of all, you need to follow the download in [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/download/), and install the distro in minimal mode.

As required packages you will only need **git** for now.

Once the installation is complete, enter in chroot and run the following commands:
(you can enter in chroot running "arch-chroot /mnt")

```
git clone https://github.com/m12Passarini/Arch-Config ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
bash install.sh 
```

Then your installation is done. Now you can type:

```
exit
hyprland
```

# Manual

For those who use Linux, especially Arch, the best manual available is the communication of each package, so feel free to explore the documentation of the packages listed in pkglist.txt.

However, for basic navigation, there are some commands that may be important for you to know from the start.

**SUPER** ==  Windows key / Command

**SUPER** + **Q** = Open terminal

**SUPER** + **SPACE** = Open search bar

**SUPER** + **E** = Open file manager

**SUPER** + **SHIFT** + **X** = Close the current window

**SUPER** + (0 - 9) = Change window

**SUPER** + **M** = Open menu (here you can shutdown the device)
